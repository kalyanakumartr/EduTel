			Biography</h4>

		<p class="paraCustom">I am the question paper of the board
			examination. Along with many twinned friends of mine, I was printed
			in a secret press, unknown to the public and kept behind closed doors
			to block any kind of leakage or fraud in the examinations. We were
			kept into separate paper bags and delivered to separate centres. On
			the examination day my packet was opened and we were handed over to
			the students who were eagerly waiting for us.</p>
		<p class="paraCustom">I was printed as a science paper and given
			to a girl, who looked so nervous that I thought I should talk to her
			and calm her down. When she read me, she gave a few jabs of
			excitement in the air and happily settled down to write in the
			answers sheet.Somewhere in the middle, she got a little confused and
			stared at me, trying to figure out the answer, I prayed she would be
			able to get her bearings right.She left that question and proceeded
			with the next to save time. The three hours in the examination room
			were the most crucial moments of my life. This little girl's future
			career would depend on what she wrote from my questions. I was
			praying to God that she would be able to remember and express in the
			best possible manner what she had studied. The bell rang and I was
			out of the hall along with the student, neatly folded in her compass
			box. She had written the answers of certain calculations on me, which
			she tallied and confirmed with her friends giving yelps of joy.</p>
		<p class="paraCustom">She came home and filed me up neatly so that
			she can preserve me for her younger cousin who would appear the
			boards next year.
