								<h2 style="color: orange">The tips are as under</h2>
								<p style="color: black;">1) First think yourself that who
									You are & what are you made for?</p>
								<p style="color: black;">2) This is the one of your Life's
									decision so don't let it be given in the hands of others.</p>

								<p style="color: black;">4) Relatives are only your advisers
									but not your Life decision bond. So their advice(s) are only to
									listen but not always to be implement.</p>
								<p style="color: black;">5) Parents, off course, no doubt
									plays a good role in shaping your career but sometimes they too
									are unaware about the latest scope & demand of the subject in
									the market. So instead of fighting with them, your task is to
									tell them the about the latest technologies & ideas in the
									current world situation.</p>
