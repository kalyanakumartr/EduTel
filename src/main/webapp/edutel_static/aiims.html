						<h1>About AIIMS</h1>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-9 col-sm-9" align="justify">
						<p><b>AIIMS</b>, New Delhi <b>All India Institute of Medical Sciences</b> was established by an Act of Parliament of
							1956 as an autonomous institution of national importance and its objectives and functions were
							defined. By virtue of this Act, the Institute awards its own medical degrees, diplomas and other
							academic distinctions.</p>
						<p>The degrees and diplomas awarded by the Institute under the<b> All India Institute of Medical Sciences</b> 
						 Act are recognized medical qualifications for the purpose of the Indian Medical Council Act and notwithstanding
						  anything contained in the Medical Council Act, are deemed to be included in the first schedule of that Act, 
						  entitling the holders to the same privileges as those attached to the equivalent awards from other universities of India. </p>
						  <p>The Institute <b>(AIIMS, New Delhi)</b> is a residential University in which the faculty members, staff and the students live on
						   campus. There are 8 hostels for undergraduate students (6 for boys and 2 for girls) with a capacity to accommodate 562 students.</p>
					   <h3>Six other AIIMS</h3>
					   <p>Under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana six new All India Institutes of Medical
                         Sciences have been established similar to AIIMS, New Delhi.</p>
                        <p>Government of India has also decided that the Academic Session for the current year in six New AIIMS at <b>Bhopal</b>, <b>Bhubaneswar</b>,
							<b>Jodhpur</b>, <b>Patna</b>, <b>Raipur</b> and <b>Rishikesh</b>, will also be started in August 2017 with intake of 100
							students for each of the new institutions.</p>
						<p>As per the directives of the Ministry selection for admission will be done through the same Entrance Examination by which candidates are
						selected for AIIMS, New Delhi. The admission will be done on the basis of merit-cum- choice of the candidates.</p>
					  
					   	<h3 class="margin-bottom-20"><u>AIIMS & OBJECTIVE</u></h3>
					   
						<p>AIIMS, New Delhi The prime focus of the Institute (AIIMS) is to develop patterns of teaching in
						   undergraduate and postgraduate medical education in all the branches so as to demonstrate a high standard of medical education to all medical colleges and allied institutions in India.</p>
						<p>The other important objectives of the Institute is to bring together in one place educational facilities of the highest order for the training of personnel in all the important branches
						 of health activities and to attain self-sufficiency in postgraduate medical education. </p>
						 <p>The educational principles and practices being adopted are those which are the best suited to the needs of the country. Adaptation of education to meet the problems of community health 
						 is a major preoccupation. </p>
						 <p>To this effect the AIIMS New, Delhi has been trying to initiate a model educational programme in the Ballabgarh Community Development Block in collaboration with the Haryana Government.
						 The Institute has also been able to initiate model educational programme in Community Medicine at the urban field practice area in Malviya Nagar, New Delhi. Emphasis is laid on the active learning process and on the cultivation of scholarly habits and scientific methods. 
						 </p>
						 <p>The first batch of undergraduate medical students was admitted to the AIIMS, Delhi in the year 1956 and since then the Institute has been admitting 50 students every year (77 from 2008 session and 107 from 2017 onwards) to the M.B.B.S. Course. The number of students
						  to this course is kept relatively small to ensure an adequate teacher student ratio.</p>
						  <p>The undergraduate curriculum is constantly reviewed at the Faculty and Staff Council levels and the required changes in the curriculum are brought about in order to evolve a pattern which is the most suitable for the Indian needs and conditions.</p>
					      <p>Undergraduate medical students get sufficient impetus for higher studies as the Institute provides facilities for postgraduate degrees in almost all the branches of medical sciences. At present, the AIIMS, Delhi is awarding post-graduate degrees in about 55 different specialties /super specialties.
					      </p>
					      <p>Six Other AIIMS Aims & objectives of the other six AIIMS Institutes are also of similar nature as mentioned above for AIIMS, New Delhi. In the six new AIIMS the admission will be for 100 seats in each Institution. The number and distribution of seats may vary depending upon the periodic directives / directions from Competent Authorities.</p>
